# GRUB Scripts
These scripts were created by me to add extra functionalities to GRUB. Please keep in mind that they may not work on all devices.

To help keep your configuration organized and prevent conflicts, I strongly recommend using your system's customization file (the most common name for this file is "40_custom"). Most operating systems also require that you run the "update-grub" command to apply your changes.

Most of these scripts are simple and can be easily added to your system's customization file. However, the script for the Windows Recovery Environment requires that you replace "0000-0000" with the respective identifier for your Windows installation. If the identifier is invalid, the script will not work.

This repository has been released with fair use in mind; I am not affiliated with the GRUB development team. **While I work to ensure that my projects are of the best quality, these scripts are provided with absolutely no warranty.** By making use of these scripts, you do so at your own risk.
